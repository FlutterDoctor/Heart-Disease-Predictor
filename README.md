# Heart-Disease-Predictor
This Python program uses the Random Forest machine-learning (ML) algorithm to predict if an individual has heart disease. The ML model was trained on over 290,000 patient surveys from the CDC and tested on an additional 80,000. The result was a prediction accuracy of over 91%.
